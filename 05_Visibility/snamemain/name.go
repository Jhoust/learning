package vis

var X = 29 // this works with a CAPITAL letter for visibility; works with a capitalized word as well
//var X int = 21 //this works, but it's a long way
//var X := 21 // this doesn't work for package level scope this is used for functions (lexical) just use the "=" sign
//X := 21  // work for scope not visibility (lexical)
//X = 21  //this does not work for visibility only for scope in packages (lexical)
//var X int = "dave" //this doesn't work because we have given it the wrong type and calling vis doesn't show it.
